# Neural translation model (English to German)
We will use a language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/ to build a neural translation model. This dataset consists of over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German. In order to make the training quicker, we will restrict to our dataset to 20,000 pairs. 

Our goal is to develop a neural translation model from English to German, making use of a pre-trained English word embedding module.
